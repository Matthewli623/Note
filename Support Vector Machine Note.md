# Support Vector Machine Note

For not linearly separable classification

## For linearly separable classification

- Find a line has a **Maximum Margin(Gap)**
- Only two point will be selected (Support Vectors)
- Positive Hyperplane / Negative Hyperplane
- These two point represent two item which has **Most Unlike and Most Extreme** in there Group(look like orange but it is apple and belong to apple group)

### Kernel

### 2D -> 3D

- Using a plane to separate two group
- project the plane to the 2D graph

### Use Kernel Function

- The Gaussian RBF kernel
- Sigmoid kernel
- Polynomial kernel
